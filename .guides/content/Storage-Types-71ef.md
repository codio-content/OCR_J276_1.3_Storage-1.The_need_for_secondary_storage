Data can be stored in primary storage, such as random access memory (RAM) but only temporarily because RAM is volatile, which means that when a computing device is switched off, data is not stored.  However, secondary storage is non-volatile, which means that secondary storage can be used as permanent storage for data.

Secondary storage allows data to be backed-up, moved from one location to another and shared between people using different types of secondary storage media.

The following video explains the difference between RAM and a hard disk and helps to clarify why we need secondary storage:

Secondary storage media can be internal or external.  Systems software and applications software can be stored on internal storage media, such as hard disks and data can be accessed very quickly from this type of storage media.  Access to data is less fast if itâ€™s stored on external storage media.
