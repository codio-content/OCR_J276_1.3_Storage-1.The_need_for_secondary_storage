In this lesson we will explore why we need secondary storage and investigate features to consider when choosing what type of storage media to use.

The amount of data that is being stored by people for work and leisure is increasing each year.  People want to store a range of digital data that includes school and college work, music, photographs, videos, films, games and emails. 

Organizations such as government departments, local councils, hospitals, supermarkets and banks need to store expanding amounts of data such as reports, emails, databases. 

People and organizations need to be able to manage and access their data without problems and data storage needs to be efficient and cost effective.
